## Project Description

Pipeline for patient-specific signaling pathway perturbation analysis based on somatic mutations and CNAs in TCGA Head-and-Neck-Squamous-Cell-Carcinoma dataset. The workflow includes cBioPortal data retrieval, driver gene identification using OncodriveCLUST, graph-based pathway analysis with NetworkX, functional enrichment with g:Profiler and gseapy, and clinical validation using Kaplan–Meier curves.
